## Your thesis
### Writing
1. Please write in active voice and present tense. For a Methods section is may be okay to write in past tense, but try to keep present tense as much as possible.
1. Read the literature to formulate your hypotheses. Graduate students may avoid something that is hard for them, like coding or reading a technical paper, and instead will read to learn specific facts about the study organism. Every thesis is framed within a broader context: population dynamics in seasonal/stochastic environments, population dynamics given different investment strategies in maturation rate, size at maturation, etc. Read papers on these topics in a very general setting (Am Nat, TREE, Ecology Letters are good journals for this) until you can state a specific hypothesis or translate facts into their relevance for your study question: Threshold growth quantities, such as R0, are equivalent in seasonal and non-seasonal environments only when specific conditions are met regarding which stages can reproduce, and which stage-to-stage transitions are possible (Mitchell and Kribs, 2017). While such conditions are met for sea lice population biology, transient, year round dynamics, and growth rates (in addition to threshold quantities) are key to understanding best management practices for sea lice, and so we aim to extend the current theory describing population growth in seasonal environments in these respects.
1. Please see 'How to write a Nature Summary'. Writing an abstract this way asks you to think about the broader relevance of your work and this is often something that doesn't receive enough attention. https://cbs.umn.edu/sites/cbs.umn.edu/files/public/downloads/Annotated_Nature_abstract.pdf
1. Please see 'Scientific paper outline by Kevin Lafferty' <http://parasitology.msi.ucsb.edu/sites/parasitology.msi.ucsb.edu/files/docs/publications/Writing%20a%20Scientific%20Paper.doc> This outline asks the writer to provide paragraphs that show you have summarized the relevant literature on your topic. One component of this is the study system, but this comes after summarizing the literature on the 'big picture' question.
1. Don't write things that aren't true or you aren't going to back up. 'Climate change is biggest problem of our generation': that sentence belongs as the first sentence of a paper describing challenges faced by different generations of humans, and yet, a sentence like that can find its way into a paper that might be titled 'Frogs decline in Northern Michigan correlated with warmer mean summer temperatures' and this paper about frogs is not going to provide the citations and context justify 'Climate change is biggest problem of our generation': the sentence is off-topic, and, as the reader, I can't be asked to believe it unless you are going to give me context and citations. Don't write things like 'Species move north due to climate change' because this is untrue unless you provide qualifiers such as 'in the northern hemisphere' and 'in absence of other environmental gradients such as in precipitation or elevation'.
1. Start the outline of your paper by deciding what figures you will include.
1. Consider Zotero for manageing your references.
1. I recommend you learn Latex and write your thesis in it.
1. Get feedback from my on your writing early. The more familar you are with the published literature the better your writing will be and the better you will be able to formulate hypotheses and explain your ideas.
1. Get your peers to read your writing.

### Coding
1. Use open source software, if possible.
1. Archive your code on Figshare and Github.
1. Consider Github to back up and share your files.

### Designing your thesis
1. Getting a chapter finished is a great accomplishment. Prioritize this over other tasks that may yield short-term rewards. Design your chapters so that they are finishable. It's not glamorous to design something that is feasible, but it will get you graduated and get you a job.
1. Here's advice on graduate school: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/rereading-stearns-and-hueys-some-modest-advice-to-graduate-students/


### Guiding principles
Do meaningful work, that _you_ are proud of, and that _you_ are certain has value: editors and reviewers will often agree, but if they don't seek solice in knowing that you didn't cut corners and you put in the work. Good work will eventually get rewarded, but the path to those rewards can sometimes be long.

### Reviewing
The BES guide to reviewing is excellent.

### Authorship and collaboration

### Computing resources

## Being a graduate student in the MUN Biology Department

### Diversity, equity, and inclusion

### Funding
Even before you start at MUN you will need to request the TAships you want.

### Student visas

### Conference travel
Get reasonable rates: book early. Visas. Reimbursment.

## Work-life balance
I quite like this advice: https://getpocket.com/explore/item/25-simple-daily-habits-that-separate-high-achievers-from-everyone-else?utm_source=pocket-newtab (even though it's pretty spammy). For me, one of the hardest things is protecting time to get everything done. I don't want to seem busy, and I want to seem like I have time to 'hang out'. For example, I need to get a meeting completed within a given amount of time, so that I can get something completed in the last 90 mins of the day. I feel guilty ending the meeting, so I let it continue, and will end up having to do the other task late at night. I think 'Who am I to say my other task is more important, than helping this person in my office?' I think first year graduate students can struggle similarly. You have classes, TAing, and it's easy to say 'Doing well at TAing and classes is more important than my thesis.' The times to finishing at MUN are tight. You need to be agressive about making time for, and making progress on, your thesis from the start.

At times, your thesis will suck. Many of us _love_ research, but research can't be your only thing. Diversify (hobbies outside of work), so that you're experiencing success in at least one area when the thesis 'sucks'. References about failure in science.

Mentoring plan.

I agree with much of the lab policies for the Bolnick Lab at the University of Connecticut (https://bolnicklab.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/labvalues/)
